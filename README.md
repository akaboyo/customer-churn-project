# PWC CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS 

## Project Overview and Phases
The primary objective of this project was to analyze customer churn for a telecom client (PhoneNow) and provide actionable insights to help reduce churn rates and improve customer retention. The project was conducted in response to a request from the clientâ€™s Retention Manager, who emphasized the high cost of acquiring new customers and the need for a proactive approach to retaining existing customers.
The analysis was carried out in several key phases, each aimed at building a comprehensive understanding of customer churn and creating self-explanatory dashboards for strategic decision-making.

## Data Collection and Preparation
### Data Sources: The dataset was provided by PWC and it included customer demographic information, account details, and service subscription data, all of which are crucial for identifying churn patterns.
Data Cleaning: The dataset was first cleaned to handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and ensure accuracy. Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical variables were normalized for model readiness.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial EDA was conducted to examine distributions, correlations, and trends related to churn, such as the churn rate by tenure, contract type, and payment method. The findings indicated that customer demographics, account information, and service subscriptions were significant contributors to churn behavior.
